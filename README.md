# README

Text to speech extension for browsers, thanks to API by ResponsiveVoice.js.
The feature is simple.
When you make a text selection, the text speaks.
TTS(Text To Speech) functionality has been made by [ResponsiveVoiceJS](http://responsivevoice.org/).
So if you feel this addon is useful, please give thanks to the original API provider [ResponsiveVoiceJS](http://responsivevoice.org/).
To toggle on/off of this addon, please click a speaker button on the browser's toolbar button.

# Powered by

* [guessLanguage.js](https://github.com/richtr/guessLanguage.js) for detecting language of selected text
